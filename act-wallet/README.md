# Tauri + Vanilla TS

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri in vanilla HTML, CSS and Typescript.

## Running

You will need *Rust*, *Node.js*, and *yarn*

```
yarn install
yarn tauri dev
```

If you want to run second instance of the app, you can change *"dev"* in *"scripts"* section of `package.json` after you run first instance from `vite` to `vite --port 1422` and change it back after you run second instance.
