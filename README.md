# Autonomi Community Token

1. Autonomi token standard, that enables issuing own token by anyone – from scratch, or by wrapping existing ERC20 tokens. It does not have to become "native" yet, since it will have much utility anyway. Based on ideas by David Irvine, DavidMc0, Traktion, Riddim and others.
2. Rust library for token operations
3. Simple GUI wallet
4. Bridge smart contract to burn tokens on Arbitrum side, with option to updgrade for 2-way operation
5. Simple exchange scheme for different tokens

Autonomi community has expressed a need for a native token format multiple times. David Irvine, and other members shared their ideas on Autonomi Forum. This project takes these ideas and aims for developing a standard for transacting on the network.

It will enable issuing own token by anyone – from scratch, or by wrapping existing ERC20 tokens from Arbitrum network. Ability to exchange one tokens for others in a completely decentralized way is also planned.

Focus is on a most open and transparent development possible, open to discussion and contributions from community.

This project is also funded by community. If the project gets any prize, supporters are repaid 150% from the prize, and rest goes to further development.

## Target audience

* Ordinary people – the wallet will be as simple as possible and let people transact easily.
* Crypto crowd and traders – will be able to exchange their favorite tokens on Autonomi.
* Developers – they will be able to integrate currency into their own projects."
