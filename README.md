# Autonomi Community Token

1. Autonomi token standard, that enables issuing own token by anyone â€“ from scratch, or by wrapping existing ERC20 tokens. It does not have to become "native" yet, since it will have much utility anyway. Based on ideas by DavidMc0, Traktion, Riddim et al.
2. Rust library for token operations
3. Simple GUI wallet
4. Bridge smart contract to burn tokens on Arbitrum side, with option to updgrade for 2-way operation
5. Simple exchange scheme for different tokens
