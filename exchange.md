# Exchange

Exchange will be based on both sides publishing a spend transaction, that are connected by inputs/outputs. Each transaction has it's own Token ID, and it will be a single exception in transaction validation process, when Token IDs can differ in parent/child relation.

## Process

* People publish offers on exchange graph (or sequence-addressed pointers?)
